## About Dataset
### Context
* The insurance.csv dataset contains 1338 observations (rows) and 7 features (columns). The dataset contains 4 numerical features (age, bmi, children and expenses) and 3 nominal 
  features (sex, smoker and region) that were converted into factors with numerical value designated for each level.

* The purposes of this exercise to look into different features to observe their relationship, and plot a multiple linear regression based on several features of individual such as 
  age, physical/family condition and location against their existing medical expense to be used for predicting future medical expenses of individuals that help medical insurance to 
  make decision on charging the premium.
